Reanimate is an intersectional feminist publishing collective that produces multimodal digital editions of archival writing by activist women in media.

In addition to its deep investment in textual recovery, Reanimate is strongly committed to integrating feminist values into open access publication through its financial model, use of labor, and reader experiences.

As a publishing collective, Reanimate is co-directed by Roopika Risam and Carol Stabile in collaboration with partners at Goldsmiths Press, Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, Fembot Collective, Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage at the University of Houston and Arte PÃºblico Press, and the University of Oregon Libraries.
