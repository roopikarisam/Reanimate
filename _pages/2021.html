Through continued support from the Center for Research and Creative Activities and School of Graduate Studies at Salem State University, we were thrilled to have Haley Mallett, a history MAT student at Salem State, join us as our research assistant during the 2020-2021 academic year.

After an industrious year, we're looking forward to launching our first three volumes in July 2020: <i>The Fredi Washington Reader</i>, which collects actress Washington’s columns from the Black newspaper <i>The People’s Voice</i>; <i>Soldadera</i>, a play by Mexican American journalist Josefina Niggli; and the autobiography of Jean Muir, a civil rights advocate who was the first performer to be blacklisted during the Second Red Scare in the 1950s.
