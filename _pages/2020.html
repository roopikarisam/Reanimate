This fall at Reanimate, we've been completing transcription and proofreading of Fredi Washington's columns from the <i>People's Voice</i> and planning for our next set of digital editions.

For Academic Year 2019-2020, we are thrilled to be joined by Nicole Warner, a social work student at Salem State University, as our graduate research assistant. Many thanks to the Center for Research and Creative Activities and School of Graduate Studies for supporting Nicole's work with Reanimate!<br>
